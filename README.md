# CNN-Metallic-Surface-Anomaly-Detection
Metallic surface detection


## Dataset : 
   
This dataset was created by  Northeastern University (NEU), consisting 1,800 grayscale images of 6 different types of typical surface defects of the hot-rolled steel strip: rolled-in scale (RS), patches (Pa), crazing (Cr), pitted surface (PS), inclusion (In) and scratches (Sc). 

For each category, 300 samples can be found in the folder.   

For each image, the original resolution is 200Ã—200 pixels.  

This Metal Surface Defects Dataset can be download at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/fantacher/neu-metal-surface-defects-data) or [Northeastern University (NEU)](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/yunhyan/NEU_surface_defect_database.html) official website.
